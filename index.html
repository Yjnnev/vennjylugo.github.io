                    <h3>Case Study 1: Optimizing E-commerce Product Recommendations</h3>
                    <p><strong>Situation:</strong> An e-commerce platform was experiencing low user engagement with its generic product recommendations, leading to missed upselling opportunities and reduced average order value.</p>
                    <p><strong>Task:</strong> To design and implement a personalized product recommendation system that could dynamically suggest relevant products to users based on their browsing history, purchase patterns, and similar user behavior.</p>
                    <p><strong>Action:</strong> I developed a hybrid recommendation engine combining collaborative filtering and content-based filtering techniques. This involved preprocessing large datasets of user interactions, training a matrix factorization model using Python with Surprise library, and integrating the recommendation API into the platform's backend. I also implemented A/B testing to compare the new system's performance against the old one.</p>
                    <p><strong>Result:</strong> The new recommendation system led to a <strong>15% increase in click-through rate</strong> on recommended products and a <strong>7% increase in the average order value</strong> within three months of deployment. User feedback also indicated higher satisfaction with the relevance of suggestions.</p>

                    <h3>Case Study 2: Developing a Real-time Anomaly Detection System for IoT Data</h3>
                    <p><strong>Situation:</strong> An industrial IoT system generated vast amounts of sensor data, but critical equipment malfunctions were often detected too late, resulting in costly downtime and maintenance.</p>
                    <p><strong>Task:</strong> To create a real-time anomaly detection system capable of identifying unusual patterns in sensor data that could indicate impending equipment failure, enabling proactive maintenance.</p>
                    <p><strong>Action:</strong> I designed and implemented a streaming data pipeline using Apache Kafka and Apache Flink to ingest and process sensor data. For anomaly detection, I utilized an unsupervised machine learning algorithm (Isolation Forest) and a time-series forecasting model (ARIMA) to predict normal behavior and flag deviations. The system was deployed on a cloud platform (AWS) using Docker containers for scalability.</p>
                    <p><strong>Result:</strong> The anomaly detection system successfully identified critical equipment issues with an <strong>85% accuracy rate and a 70% reduction in false positives</strong> compared to previous rule-based alerts. This allowed maintenance teams to intervene proactively, leading to a <strong>20% decrease in unscheduled downtime</strong> and significant cost savings.</p>
